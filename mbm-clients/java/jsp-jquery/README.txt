MultiBit Merchant (JSP and jQuery client)
=========================================

Please refer to the main README.txt for the current state of the project and lines of development.

Description
-----------
This module provides a full-blown Java web application that acts as a demonstration of how MBM could be used as part
of a hosted online shop with the back end running on another part of the network (perhaps in a more managed environment).

Getting started
---------------

Build and run up the both the main MBM module and the client with the following command

mvn clean jetty:run

Then open http://localhost:8080/mbm/index.html in a browser and you should see the demonstration online shop.

Advanced exploration
--------------------
To test out the entire API you can work through all the various links on the site which provide both the front-end
user experience, and the back-end order fulfilment and accounting experiences.
