MultiBit Merchant (jQuery client)
=================================

Please refer to the main README.txt for the current state of the project and lines of development.

Description
-----------
This module provides a JavaScript demonstration of how MBM could be used as part of a blog site.
It has been assumed that the blog has little or no server side processing available to the blogger who is just
interested in offering a few of their own products for sale through Bitcoin.

Getting started
---------------

Build and run up the main MBM module with the following command

mvn clean jetty:run

Then open http://localhost:8080/mbm-client/index.html in a browser and you should see a demonstration blog.
